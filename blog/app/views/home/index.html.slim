    .name Fallout
    p  Fallout: A Post Nuclear Role Playing Game, also referred to as simply Fallout, developed by Interplay and its division, Dragonplay, and self-published on September 30, 1997, is the first game in the Fallout series. The game was initially intended to use Steve Jackson Games' GURPS system, but when Interplay made the decision to drop GURPS on February 12, 1997, it created its own system, SPECIAL. Fallout is seen as the "spiritual successor" to Interplay's classic 1987 CRPG Wasteland. The designers proposed many titles, but they agreed on titling it Armageddon. However, they found out that another Interplay project was going to use that title, so they were obligated to switch again, and Fallout was the teamâ€™s favorite among the remainder.
